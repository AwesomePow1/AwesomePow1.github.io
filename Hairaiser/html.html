    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> 2D Platformer</p>
    <p><strong>Development:</strong> January 2021 - April 2021</p>
    <p><strong>Language:</strong> C</p>
    <p><strong>Engine:</strong> AlphaEngine (provided by DigiPen)</p>
    <p>This was my second DigiPen student project, and this time we had the
       entire second semester of my freshman year to work on it. My biggest
       contribution to our team was the in-engine level editor, filled with
       features that allowed us to create/modify all of the levels that you see
       in the game. I was also able to add any additional features by request of
       my teammates, such as the placement of enemies and background elements
       such as the torches and stairs. In addition, I implemented the playerâ€™s
       attack and animation functionality, as well as the music and many of the
       sound effects heard within the game.</p>
