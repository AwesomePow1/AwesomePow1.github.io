    <h3><em>Tetris</em> Clone</h3>
    <h3>solo project</h3>
    <p><strong>Development:</strong> May 2021 - August 2021</p>
    <p><strong>Language:</strong> C++</p>
    <p><strong>Engine:</strong> Custom, with SFML for low-level graphics support</p>
    <p>After completing my freshman year at DigiPen, I wanted to keep my skills
       sharp and practice what I had been learning, especially custom engine
       development. So, I spent half of the summer creating my own component-
       based engine, with all the systems and GameObject components that I or
       someone else would need to make a game of their own. Then when I was
       happy with my progress, I tested this engine by creating "temtris" and
       everything went smoothly! This was a great exercise to test my knowledge
       and competence as a game developer, and now I have a solid engine that I
       can use to easily create other projects and expand upon in later years as
       I learn even more.</p>
