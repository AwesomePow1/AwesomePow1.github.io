    <h3>personal project</h3>
    <h3>Role: Solo Custom Engine Developer</h3>
    <p><strong>Development:</strong> May 2021 - present</p>
    <p><strong>Language:</strong> C++</p>
    <p>After completing my freshman year at DigiPen, I wanted to keep my skills
       sharp and practice what I had been learning, especially custom engine
       development. So, I spent most of the summer creating my own 
       component-based engine, with all the systems and GameObject components 
       that I or someone else would need to make a game of their own. As my time 
       at DigiPen continued I learned more about graphics and OpenGL and changed 
       the rendering backend from SFML to my own OpenGL code. My most recent 
       addition has been integrating Dear ImGui to allow myself and enginebyebba's 
       "clients" to edit various aspects of the engine and the game during 
       runtime without ever having to edit JSON files. enginebyebba is a 
       culmination and demonstration of everything I have learned at DigiPen, 
       while also allowing me to easily create games with this foundation.</p>
    <!--ABOUT ENGINEBYEBBA-->

        <div class="column2">
            <p>enginebyebba is a component-based engine. Tasks are broken down 
                 and handled by Systems, which all inherit from the pure virtual
                 System class, and provide the functioning basis of the engine, 
                 from loading GameObjects to playing music and sound effects to 
                 handling user input. Altogether, these Systems handle much of 
                 the low-level functionality and abstract this from the user, 
                 allowing them to use enginebyebba to jump right into making 
                 games.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--JSON & GameObjects-->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
            <p>Most data in enginebyebba is stored in JSON files, which are read 
                from and written to using the JSON parser I wrote using 
                nlohmann's JSON For Modern C++. Data subheaders are deliminated 
                with "/" for ease of getting or outputting data. For example, 
                GameObjects use JSON files to store data about their Components. 
                In enginebyebba, GameObjects are essentially containers of 
                Components, and each Component, similar to Systems, inherits 
                from a pure virtual class and performs its own tasks each frame. 
                Data for each component is stored in these JSON files (such as 
                position/rotation/scale for the Transform component, texture 
                image and shader for the Sprite component, etc.), and the 
                GameObject reads in these Components' data one by one. When in 
                <a href="#editor">Editor</a> mode, the user can also dynamically 
                edit the Component's values and the changes will be written back 
                to the JSON files.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column2">
            <img src="ebba_json.png" style="width:100%">

    </div>
    <!--Graphics Pipeline-->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
          <img src="ebba_graphicspipeline1.png" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column2">
          <img src="ebba_graphicspipeline2.png" style="width:100%">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>The graphics pipeline in enginebyebba is broken down into several 
        components, from the Mesh that everything renders on top of, the Texture 
        that contains the actual image to render, and the Shader that says how 
        this object will be rendered. Each are stored as separate objects to 
        allow for reusing, mixing, and matching graphical components to save 
        resources at runtime. The loading and storing of these graphical 
        components is handled by the Graphics Library, and displays all of the 
        different objects in the data files as options in a dropdown in the 
        <a href="#editor">Editor</a>.</p>

    <p>Using enginebyebba to make games is made even easier by the addition of 
        Dear ImGui, also known as the EditorSystem to enginebyebba, allowing the 
        user to edit any gameplay values at runtime. The goal of this system is 
        to have the user interact with JSON files as little as possible and 
        focus instead on rapid changes and iteration. The layout of the menu and 
        hooks was designed and implemented entirely by me using the Dear ImGui 
        library, and everything from the starting System settings to a 
        GameObject's properties and its Components' properties can be edited and 
        saved, all without the user even opening the JSON file themselves. The 
        video above shows only a portion of the EditorSystem's capabilities, and 
        additional features are always in the works.</p>

    <p>During the summer of 2021, I was happy with the progress of enginebyebba, 
       so I began testing it by creating "temtris". This project showed me both 
       the strengths of enginebyebba and revealed many quality-of-life changes 
       that I wished to make. As for temtris itself, I used a 2D array to 
       simulate the game environment and then translated it to modern graphics 
       to make this flashy, colorful <i>Tetris</i> clone!</p>
