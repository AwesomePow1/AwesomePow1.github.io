    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Emma Cross, and I am a junior BSCSRTIS major at
        DigiPen Institute of Technology and aspiring game programmer. I have
        experience in C++, Java, and Unity, as well as a love for gameplay
        programming, engine development, and OpenGL graphics programming. I’m
        very passionate about computer science and game development, and I’ve
        worked on a multitude of projects both on my own and collaboratively
        with a team of game developers. I love to work hard and I’m up for any
        challenge, and I’m more than willing to put in the time to produce high-
        quality projects. In my free time, I love music and playing the marimba 
        and the vibraphone, and I like to compose my own music or transcribe music
        that I love. I’m also a huge spreadsheet enthusiast and love writing
        searching & sorting scripts for detailed spreadsheets that help me
        organize many aspects of my life. I’m excited to be a part of a
        dedicated, hardworking team and create more amazing projects!
