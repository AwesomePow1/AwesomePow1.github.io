    <h3>2D Top-Down Shooter</h3>
    <h3>by Bright Thinkers (3 programmers)</h3>
    <p class="desc">Use your laser guns to defeat waves of robot bugs!</p>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Game programmer</p>
    <p><strong>Development:</strong> October 2020 - December 2020</p>
    <p><strong>Language:</strong> C</p>
    <p><strong>Engine:</strong> CProcessing (provided by DigiPen)</p>
    <p>This was my first student project in my first semester at DigiPen. As 1
       of 3 programmers on the team, I implemented the options menu and its
       functionality, as well as the object structure and functionality of the
       guns, projectiles, and water balloon grenades. And because we did not
       have a dedicated sound designer on the team, I also created the various
       sound effects heard within the game using Audacity and worked with the
       FMOD low-level API for playback during the game.</p>

    <p>One of my greatest contributions to Turreting Test was the water balloon
       mechanic, in which players could launch these projectiles at the robot
       bugs and deal damage. The smooth arc seen in the image is actually
       made up of tiny line segments that I drew incrementally by following an
       angle 't' around the arc shape, as seen in the code sample below.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
            <code><pre>
// len = length of arc trajectory (distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2))
float t = 0.0f;
float tstep = 180.0f / (float)NUM_SEGMENTS * (x1 < x2 ? 1 : -1);
// Calculate the midpoint so that the arc draws FROM the player and not AROUND the player
float mdptx = (x1 + x2) / 2.0f;
float mdpty = (y1 + y2) / 2.0f;
// Calculate the 1st startpoint
float curx = (float)cos(CP_Math_Radians(t)) * len + mdptx;
float cury = (float)sin(CP_Math_Radians(t)) * len + mdpty;
// Draw a bunch of tiny little lines in succession to make one giant arc
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SEGMENTS; i++)
{
    // Increment angle to traverse the arc
    t += tstep;
    // Calculate the endpoints of this tiny segment
    float nextx = (float)cos(CP_Math_Radians(t)) * len + mdptx; 
    float nexty = (float)sin(CP_Math_Radians(t)) * len + mdpty;
    // Draw the tiny segment
    drawLineOffset(curx, cury, nextx, nexty);
    // Update the new startpoints for the next iteration
    curx = nextx;
    cury = nexty;
}
            </pre></code>
